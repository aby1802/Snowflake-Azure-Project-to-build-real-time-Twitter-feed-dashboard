# Snowflake-Azure-Project-to-build-real-time-Twitter-feed-dashboard
Business Overview

Companies miss opportunities and are exposed to risk as a result of delays in company operations and decision-making. Organizations can move rapidly based on real-time data since it reveals issues and opportunities. Data that is gathered, processed, and evaluated in real-time is referred to as real-time data, and it comprises data that is ready to utilize as soon as it is created. A snapshot of historical data is what near real-time data is. When speed is critical, near real-time processing is preferred, although processing time in minutes rather than seconds is acceptable. Batch data that has been previously stored is considerably slower, and by the time it is ready to use, it might be days old.

In this project, we ingest generated Twitter feeds to Snowflake in near real-time that will power an in-built dashboard utility in Snowflake to obtain popularity feeds reports.
Data Pipeline

A data pipeline is a technique for transferring data from one system to another. The data may or may not be updated, and it may be handled in real-time (or streaming) rather than in batches. The data pipeline encompasses everything from harvesting or acquiring data using various methods to storing raw data, cleaning, validating, and transforming data into a query-worthy format, displaying KPIs, and managing the above process
